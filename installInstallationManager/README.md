Small playbook to install the [IBM Installation Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/installation-manager-and-packaging-utility-download-documents)  from a local repository and then upgrade the `cacerts` to include the certificates for the local systems.

To install the IM, the version is needed to be passed into the playbook:
```
