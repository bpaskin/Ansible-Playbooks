# Ansible-Playbooks

A collection of Ansible Playbooks that install, upgrade Liberty, IHS, Plugin, tWAS.  I have other playbooks to test URLs to make sure they are coming back with an HTTP 200.

The playbooks are usually being run from an Ansible Tower, but not a necessity, as long as the proper parameters are passed to the playbooks.

It should be noted that Liberty is prepackaged with customer specific elements and downloaded internally.  These are just samples to help others who may need some help.
